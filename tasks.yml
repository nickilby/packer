# Overview

Current state is that packer takes the 20.04 legacy ISO and uses a preseed file to deploy the image and convert into template. 
With the plus of a single ansible playbook to deploy node exporter to prove how that works.

#Issues 
 1: So far using US langauge and locale as this was a stumbling block getting it to work with GB.
 2: Using legacy ISO and preseed. As of 20.04 you can use live ISO with config file. This would be future proof.
 3: Not using HTTP server to pass preseed/config file as believe issue with port number/filewall access. (random port selection)
 4: Using pfsense as DHCP server in LAN, ideally would have a DHCP server in its own network of packer.
